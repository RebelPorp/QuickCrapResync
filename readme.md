To start you need to install the latest version of ffmpeg from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip
then add 
C:\Insert user stuff here\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin
to your PATH

then place your video into the same folder as this file and rename it "video.mp4" and run the run.bat file

Warning it does glitch it out in the first few secs
